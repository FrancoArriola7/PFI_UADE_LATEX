\begin{Abstract}

    \indent This Final Engineering Project proposes the development of an AI-driven analysis and prediction system for stores that sell perishable goods. Conceived as a web-based software product, the project seeks to optimize the daily production of small and medium-sized retailers in Buenos Aires in 2025 by forecasting demand, thereby reducing food waste and improving profitability.\\

    \indent The platform will combine time-series forecasting models and artificial intelligence to generate item-level predictions, process sales records extracted from images, and provide an analytics engine that—through a dashboard and a conversational chatbot—delivers key indicators and actionable recommendations to users. The MVP will comprise a prediction module, KPI visualizations, image ingestion, alerts for overproduction or stock-outs, and week-over-week comparisons.\\
    
    \indent Expected benefits include lower shrinkage, higher operating margins, more professional management, and optimized procurement of raw materials. Ultimately, the system aims to furnish perishable-goods retailers with an innovative tool that aligns production with real demand, supports food sustainability, and bolsters competitiveness in a challenging economic environment.
