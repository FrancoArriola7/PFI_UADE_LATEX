    %This Final Engineering Project proposes the development of an analysis and prediction system based on artificial intelligence, named AIVA, designed for businesses that sell perishable goods. The main objective is to optimize daily production by accurately estimating demand, in order to reduce food waste and improve business profitability. To achieve this, the system leverages key variables such as sales history, day of the week, weather conditions, special dates, and purchasing behavior. These variables are essential, as they have a direct impact on consumption patterns. By incorporating these factors into the prediction process, AIVA aims to provide accurate and contextualized information that enables merchants to make more informed and efficient decisions.

    %The platform will combine time-series forecasting models and artificial intelligence to generate item-level predictions, process sales records extracted from images, and provide an analytics engine that—through a dashboard and a conversational chatbot—delivers key indicators and actionable recommendations to users. The MVP will comprise a prediction module, KPI visualizations, image ingestion, alerts for overproduction or stock-outs, and week-over-week comparisons.\\

    %Expected benefits include lower shrinkage, higher operating margins, more professional management, and optimized procurement of raw materials. Ultimately, the system aims to furnish perishable-goods retailers with an innovative tool that aligns production with real demand, supports food sustainability, and bolsters competitiveness in a challenging economic environment.
